🛠️ Data Engineering Tools – Web Scraping & Access Control Demo

This repository contains code developed for data engineering tasks focused on automation, data ingestion, and access control management, using real-world examples from web scraping and cloud data governance.

The contents are organized as follows:

🌐 1. Brazilian Holidays Scraper – ANBIMA
Type: Python Script (.py)
Technology: requests, BeautifulSoup, pyspark, Spark DataFrame API

Description:
A data operator that scrapes official holiday dates from the ANBIMA website and ingests them into a Silver layer using Apache Spark. This component is designed for integration into a modern data platform to support consistent holiday calendars for operational and analytical workloads.

🔐 2. Access Control Demo – IAM + Tag-Based Governance
Type: Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
Demo Context: Presented in a technical session to illustrate a tag-based access control strategy for datasets.

Description:
A conceptual and technical demonstration of automating access control using tag keys, tag values, IAM roles, and dataset policies. This approach is aligned with fine-grained access control models commonly adopted in cloud environments like Google Cloud or AWS.
